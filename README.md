# image-convertor
The code converts a jpeg file to a png file and generates an error message if the input file type is not of jpeg format.
The code inputs an entire file path including file name.file type. Eg:D:\Pics\coorg\coorg Team trip\DSC_8082.JPG .
Also it asks the user if they want to repeat the task. If the input is "y", the code runs again, if "n", execution stops.
